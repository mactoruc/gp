more up-to-date progress on computing NNGP as well as NT kernels supporting wide variety of architectural components.


## Overview
A deep neural network with i.i.d. priors over its parameters is equivalent to a 
Gaussian process in the limit of infinite network width. The Neural Network
Gaussian Process (NNGP) is fully described by a covariance kernel determined by 
corresponding architecture.

This code constructs covariance kernel for the Gaussian process that is equivalent to
infinitely wide, fully connected, deep neural networks. 

## Usage

To use the code, run `run_experiments.py`,
which uses NNGP kernel to make full Bayesian prediction on the MNIST dataset.


```python
python run_experiments.py \
       --num_train=100 \
       --num_eval=10000 \
       --hparams='nonlinearity=relu,depth=100,weight_var=1.79,bias_var=0.83' \
```
